Aiden Numbers are a great indicator of ones academic prowess and potential. Simply put, your Aiden Number details your "physical distance" from one of the greatest thinkers of our era, Aiden Cohen. If you have ever collaborated with Aiden on a project, you have an Aiden Number of 1. Congratulations. Very few people today have an Aiden Number of 1, and most in this category are pioneering thinkers dedicated to advanced research. Many Nobel Laureates and Fields Medalists belong in this category. If you have ever had a casual conversation with Aiden, you have an Aiden Number of 2. Although known by many, Aiden only chooses to interact with people who are able to understand the complexities of his ideas. Being a member of this category certifies you as an avant-garde intellectual, who will undoubtedly be successful in the future. If Aiden remembers you, but has not had a casual conversation with you yet, you have an Aiden Number of 3. Currently, 0 people occupy this category. Many are tempted to think they belong in this category, but they fail to realize Aiden's mind operates on a higher plane of existence and he forgets names and faces of unimportant people quite often. If you have interacted with Aiden but he has forgotten you, you have an Aiden Number of 4. The people Aiden forgets about can be described as 'mediocre'. Although Aiden initially saw a trace of potential, it has now faded.

If you have seen Aiden, you have an Aiden Number of 5. Unfortunately, Aiden has not deemed you worthy enough of interacting with him. On the bright side, simply being in close proximity to Aiden has risen your intelligence.

If you, reading this article, realize you belong in this category - travel to Madison, Wisconsin at once. Meeting Aiden Cohen has positively impacted millions of lives, with some calling him 'The New Messiah'

            If you don't know who Aiden is, you have an Aiden Number of 7. People in this category are the ignorant sheep of society who have no valuable skills or talents.
